# Module 4 Project: Taskinator

## Description
This week, while learning about Web APIs and the DOM, we built a Kanban style task-tracker app called Taskinator.  Features of this application include the ability to add, delete, and edit tasks, as well as move tasks between columns with the drag-and-drop feature. 

## Overview of Concepts Learned
* The ```document``` object and it's relationship to HTML
* Using the ```window``` object for local and session storage
* DOM API methods to select and dynamically generate HTML
* DOM API methods for event handling
* Time functions and event driven functions
* How to use Web API documentation
* Publishing to the web using GitHub Pages
